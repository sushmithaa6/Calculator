# Calculator
Calculator is a web application built using HTML,CSS and JS.
I created a fully functional calculator application. It provides the necessary tools to capture user input, perform calculations, and display results dynamically. 
The calculator application built using HTML and CSS showcases the power of web development to create functional and visually appealing tools by seamlessly combining the structure and markup capabilities of HTML with the styling and interactivity of CSS.
