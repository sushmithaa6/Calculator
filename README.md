# Calculator
Calculator is a web application built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
By leveraging the power of JavaScript, I create a fully functional calculator application. JavaScript provides the necessary tools to capture user input, perform calculations, and display results dynamically. Using Javascript we can build the basic calculator and create a more robust and feature-rich calculator application.
