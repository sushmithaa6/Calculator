# Calculator
It's a calculator web app built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
By leveraging the power of JavaScript, we can create a fully functional calculator application. JavaScript provides the necessary tools to capture user input, perform calculations, and display results dynamically. With a solid understanding of JavaScript's event handling and mathematical operations, you can build upon the basic calculator we discussed here and create a more robust and feature-rich calculator application.
